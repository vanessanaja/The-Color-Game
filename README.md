# The Color Game

This was a really fun practice project for Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp which I still like to use for fun and to improve my rgb skills today.

We create a game that displays squares of random RGB colors. You are asked to guess which square represents the RGB that is provided. This is a great way to improve and practice your RGB skills.
